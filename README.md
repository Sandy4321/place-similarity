# Place similarity for determining infectious disease vector risks

#### Goals/Needs

1. Develop disease likelihood use cases
2. Integrate existing ontologies ([VectorBase](https://www.vectorbase.org/), [EnvO](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo), etc.)
3. Investigate suitable backend (Neo4j, OrientDB, etc)
4. Google Knowledge Graph search results?
5. Find data
6. Scientific justification - similarity metrics related to geospatial coverage, attributes, links to other things...

### Stay tuned
